## SOLID

SOLID are design principles used on object oriented programming languages.  It is an acronym that refers to five design principles:

- [**S**ingle Responsibility](/solid/single-responsibility/README.md)
- [**O**pen Closed Principle](/solid/open-closed/README.md)
- [**L**iskov Substitution](/solid/liskov-substitution/README.md)
- [**I**nterface Segregation](/solid/interface-segregation/README.md)
- [**D**ependency Inversion](/solid/dependency-inversion/README.md)

Even they are not considered design patterns, they are often referenced by them.

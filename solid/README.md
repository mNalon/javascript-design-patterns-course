## SOLID

SOLID are design principles used on object oriented programming languages.  It is an acronym that refers to five design principles:

- [**S**ingle Responsibility](/solid/single-responsibility/README.md)
- [**O**pen Closed Principle](/solid/open-closed/README.md)
- [**L**iskov Substitution]()
- [**I**nterface Segregation]()
- [**D**ependence Inversion]()

Even they are not considered design patterns, they are often referenced by them.

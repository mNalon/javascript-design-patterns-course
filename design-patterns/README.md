## Design Patterns

Design Patterns are basically patterns that are common architectural approaches to solve known software problems. 

The literature has a categorization that splits the design patterns into three main categories: 

- [Creational Patterns](/design-patterns/creational-patterns/README.md)
- [Structural Patterns]()
- [Behavioral Patterns]()

This categorization is known as **Gamma Categorization**.

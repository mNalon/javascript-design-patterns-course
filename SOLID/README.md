## SOLID

SOLID are design principles used on object oriented programming languages.  It is an acronym that refers to five design principles:

- [**S**ingle Responsibility]()
- [**O**pen Closed Principle]()
- [**L**iskov Substitution]()
- [**I**nterface Segregation]()
- [**D**ependence Inversion]()

Even they are not considered design patterns, they are often referenced by them.
